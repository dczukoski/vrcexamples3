# VRC Intro to C++

This is example code from the Robot Revolution Introduction to C++ course.

http://robotrevolution.net

The code usally has 3-4 versions of many concepts:
1. Quick and dirty
2. Using ranges for more accuracy
3. Using proportional control (full PID is left for further student development)

## Concepts
1. Screen display on Brain and Controller
2. Autonomous Turning
3. Autonomous Driving

## Notes
The code has been written for cut/paste usage. Things that could be moved to global constants or header files are still in each function. There are extra lines of code and variables to show as much of the concept as possible.
